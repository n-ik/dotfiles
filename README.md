#  Dotfiles
My macOS / Linux / Bash on Windows dotfiles. 
(at the moment, only macOS was tested)

## Installation
Clone the repository in your home directory

```bash
git clone git@github.com:n-ik/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

The following script will create the symlink to your home dofiles and move the old files in ~/.old_dotfiles

```bash
bash ~/.dotfiles/bootstrap.sh
```
